I have created a landing page, an ideal web development project for beginners. It requires basic
knowledge of HTML and CSS. Through this project, I have learned to create columns, divide
sections, arrange items, and add headers and footers. The most important aspect is
unleashing my creativity to design an impressive page. 
 In short, a landing page project allows us to apply HTML and CSS skills,
encouraging our creativity while ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly design.
